# The Paperhat Workshop Semantic Authoring System

Paperhat Workshop is a **semantic authoring and realization system**.

It exists to let meaning, intent, and structure be authored independently of any particular presentation, runtime, or delivery target.

Workshop is designed to support multiple targets, including (but not limited to):

* web applications
* print and PDF
* ebooks
* audio and voice
* video and SVG
* data export and interchange
* knowledge graphs

---

## What Workshop Is Not

Workshop is **not**:

* a web framework
* a UI toolkit
* a CMS
* a static site generator
* a templating system
* a renderer
* a runtime environment
* a general-purpose programming language

Those concerns are intentionally external and out of scope.

## Status

Paperhat Workshop is under active development.

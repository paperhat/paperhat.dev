## Codex Certification Mark Definition

Status: NORMATIVE
Lock State: LOCKED
Version: 1.0.0
Editor: Charles F. Munat

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Codex Certification Mark** and the conditions under which it may be used.

The purpose of the certification mark is to:

* provide a legally enforceable signal of **conformance** to the Codex Language Specification
* prevent false or misleading claims of Codex compatibility
* protect the semantic integrity of the Codex language ecosystem

---

### 2. Certification Mark

The certification mark consists of:

* the phrase **“Codex® Conformant”**
  **or**
* an officially designated **Codex Conformance Logo**

(collectively, the **Certification Mark**).

The Certification Mark is owned by **Paperhat, Limited**.

Paperhat, Limited does **not** itself use the Certification Mark in commerce, except to indicate certified third-party implementations.

---

### 3. Meaning of Certification

Use of the Certification Mark signifies that the certified implementation:

* fully conforms to all applicable **LOCKED normative Codex documents**
* correctly implements Codex syntax, structure, and declared semantics
* passes the official Codex Conformance Test Suite for the claimed version(s)

Certification is **version-specific**.

A certified implementation MUST clearly state:

* the Codex version(s) certified
* any declared implementation limits explicitly permitted by the specification

---

### 4. Prohibited Uses

The Certification Mark MUST NOT be used to:

* describe non-conformant, partial, experimental, or draft implementations
* imply endorsement of implementation quality, performance, or fitness for purpose
* suggest that Paperhat, Limited authors, maintains, or endorses the implementation itself

Any use of the Certification Mark outside the terms of the Conformance License constitutes trademark infringement.

---

### 5. Relationship to the Codex Name

The Certification Mark governs **claims of conformance**, not descriptive references.

Use of the words “Codex”, “Codex language”, or “Codex-compatible” outside the Certification Mark does **not** imply certification and MUST NOT be presented in a misleading manner.

---

### 6. Authority

This document is **NORMATIVE and LOCKED**.

Any claim of Codex conformance MUST be interpreted in accordance with this definition.

---

**End of Codex Certification Mark Definition v1.0.0**

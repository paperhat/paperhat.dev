# Paperhat Workshop for Banking

Banks struggle less with system failure than with semantic drift: the same data means different things in different systems, teams, or regulatory contexts.

Paperhat Workshop provides a single, authoritative definition of meaning for banking concepts such as products, customer states, risk classifications, and eligibility rules.

All rules are explicit, schema-governed, and closed-world. Data either conforms or fails for a specific, explainable reason. There is no inference, guessing, or environment-dependent behaviour.

This allows banks to:
- enforce consistent interpretation across systems and vendors
- trace decisions back to the exact rule in force at the time
- change policy without rewriting downstream systems
- reduce regulatory and audit risk caused by inconsistent semantics

Workshop is deliberately conservative and deterministic, prioritising auditability and long-term correctness over flexibility or speed.

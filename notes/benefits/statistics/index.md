# Paperhat Workshop for Statistics and Census Agencies

Statistical data remains valuable only if its meaning is preserved across time, revisions, and methodological change.

Paperhat Workshop allows agencies to define statistical concepts, classifications, and constraints explicitly, with clear versioning and backward compatibility rules.

This supports:
- consistent interpretation of long-running datasets
- transparent handling of definition changes
- reproducible derivation of published figures
- clear distinction between historical and current meanings

Workshop ensures that future analysts can understand not just the data, but what the data was intended to mean when it was collected and processed.

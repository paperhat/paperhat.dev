# Paperhat Workshop for Regulators and Oversight Bodies

Regulatory decisions must be explainable years later, under changing rules and interpretations.

Paperhat Workshop provides a way to define regulatory concepts, thresholds, and constraints explicitly and deterministically, independent of any single system or vendor.

Key properties:
- closed-world rules with no implicit assumptions
- deterministic validation with stable outcomes
- versioned definitions tied to time and authority
- clear traceability from decision to governing rule

This allows regulators to:
- enforce consistent interpretation across organisations
- evolve rules without rewriting enforcement systems
- audit past decisions against the rules that applied at the time
- reduce ambiguity and discretionary interpretation

Workshop supports governance by making regulatory meaning explicit and inspectable, not embedded in code or prose.

# Paperhat Workshop for Academia and Research

Academic work often loses meaning over time: assumptions live in papers, code, or personal knowledge rather than in a durable, inspectable form.

Paperhat Workshop treats meaning as a first-class research artifact. Variables, constraints, definitions, and assumptions are explicitly defined, versioned, and machine-verifiable.

This enables:
- reproducible research beyond version control
- long-lived datasets that remain interpretable decades later
- explicit handling of evolving definitions and schemas
- interdisciplinary collaboration without semantic ambiguity

Workshop separates meaning from implementation, allowing research software and data to be reviewed, reused, and reinterpreted correctly long after original authors have moved on.

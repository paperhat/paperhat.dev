# Paperhat Workshop for Archives, Libraries, and Records

Preservation without preserved meaning is data loss.

Paperhat Workshop enables archives and records institutions to capture the intended meaning, constraints, and structure of records alongside the data itself.

Features relevant to long-term stewardship:
- explicit semantic definitions
- schema evolution without reinterpretation of history
- deterministic validation of records against their original rules
- independence from specific storage or access systems

This allows future users to interpret records correctly, even when the original systems, software, or institutional context no longer exist.

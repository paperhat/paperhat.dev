# Paperhat Workshop for Healthcare Systems

Healthcare data is governed by evolving definitions, eligibility rules, and reporting requirements, where mistakes have high cost.

Paperhat Workshop provides explicit, schema-governed definitions of clinical concepts, states, and constraints, enforced deterministically.

Benefits include:
- consistent interpretation across clinical, administrative, and reporting systems
- clear explanation of why data or decisions are valid or invalid
- safe evolution of rules without silent behavioural change
- reduced risk from implicit assumptions or hidden logic

Workshop avoids inference and implicit defaults, making it suitable for environments where correctness, auditability, and patient safety matter more than flexibility.

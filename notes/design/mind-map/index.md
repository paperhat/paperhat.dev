# Visual Mind Map (textual layout)

## Graphic Design as a Language

**Alphabet → Elements**
**Grammar → Principles**
**Structure → Typography & Grid**

---

### A. Elements (visual vocabulary)

* Point → origin, focus
* Line → direction, division, rhythm
* Shape → 2-D boundary
* Form → 3-D volume
* Light → illumination, contrast
* Color → hue, value, saturation, mood
* Texture → surface quality
* Scale → relative size, emphasis
* Movement → eye flow, sequencing
* Space → positive/negative organization

**Semantic role:**
➡ These define the **raw perceptual primitives** of visual communication.

---

### B. Principles (visual grammar)

**Balance & Order**

* Balance, Symmetry, Asymmetry, Proportion, Frame, Grid-precursor logic

**Perception & Gestalt**

* Closure, Figure–Ground, Contrast, Tension

**Expression & Transformation**

* Expression, Abstraction, Tone

**Repetition & Representation**

* Pattern, Image

**Semantic role:**
➡ These govern **relationships between primitives** → meaning emerges here.

---

### C. Structural Systems

* **Typography** → linguistic form embodied visually
* **Grid** → spatial logic enabling coherence and hierarchy

**Semantic role:**
➡ These create **readable, scalable communication systems**.

---

### Whole-system insight

**Elements → combined by Principles → organized by Systems → produce Meaning.**

This mirrors:

* linguistics → phonemes → syntax → discourse
* software → primitives → rules → architecture
* **Workshop/Codex → tokens → schema constraints → realizations**

---

If useful, next I can produce:

* a **Codex schema of graphic-design semantics**
* a **mapping from design principles → Workshop realization rules**
* or a **formal ontology of visual composition**

Those would connect this book *directly* into your architecture.

## Core equation

**Meaningful design = Elements + Principles + Structure**

## Elements → “What you see”

| Category         | Key question                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Point            | Where is attention?          |
| Line             | Where does the eye move?     |
| Shape/Form       | What object exists?          |
| Color/Light/Tone | What mood or hierarchy?      |
| Texture          | What tactile implication?    |
| Scale            | What importance?             |
| Space            | What separation or grouping? |
| Movement         | What reading path?           |

## Principles → “How it works”

| Principle group                | Function                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Balance / Symmetry / Asymmetry | Stability vs energy     |
| Contrast                       | Visibility & hierarchy  |
| Figure–Ground                  | Perceptual clarity      |
| Closure                        | Cognitive completion    |
| Tension                        | Visual drama            |
| Proportion                     | Harmony                 |
| Abstraction / Expression       | Emotional meaning       |
| Pattern / Image                | Rhythm & representation |
| Frame                          | Context boundary        |

## Structure → “How it communicates”

| System     | Role                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Typography | Encodes language visually             |
| Grid       | Ensures order, alignment, scalability |
